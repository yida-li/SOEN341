# Project VibeZ

    SOEN 341 Social Media Project Winter 2020

## Objective

    Develop a simplified version of Instagram

## Project description

    Using social media may be a frustrating experience. Expressing your true opinion on content posted
    by these "influencers" or even your friends may be a daunting task, and let's be honest, you don't
    want all the attention and hate coming your way from their fans. Introducing VibeZ, the social
    media platform that keeps it 100% real (but you can do so anonymously). Is your friend being annoying?
    Do you want to tell them your real opinion but don't want to hurt their feelings? Give them a vibe
    check, and maybe others might just be thinking the same. Is what that influencer says #fact?
    Support them with that vibe check too.

## Core features

    1. Ability to post pictures

    2. Ability to follow users

    3. Leave comment on pictures

## Extra features

1.  Rating system: what is the "vibe" of the content the user sees.
    This feature allows for negative ratings, i.e. if user finds the content
    offensive. There are default vibes and custom vibes (a word) dynamically
    added by users/followers. This feature is similar to existing feature in Slack.
    However, users may decide to react using custom "vibes" made by other users.

        2. News feed similar to Instagram
